## How does it works?
### Random Keys
- The Application generates a random number valued between $\0-10^8$
- The keys are randomly generated and never repeated
### 24-hour valid key
- In this Application generates a new different key which can be only used for one day i.e..(A key generated on 10-11-2022 at 11:59:59 can't be used at 11-11-2022 at 12:00:01
- Make sure you have enough duration of time before using it.
**Note**- Once encrypted it cannot be decrypted back Again.
